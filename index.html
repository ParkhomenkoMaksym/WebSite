    <p> An advanced persistent threat (APT) is a covert cyber attack on 
        a computer network where the attacker gains and maintains unauthorized 
        access to the targeted network and remains undetected for a significant 
        period. During the time between infection and remediation the hacker 
        will often monitor, intercept, and relay information and sensitive data. 
        The intention of an APT is to exfiltrate or steal data rather than 
        cause a network outage, denial of service or infect systems with malware.

    <h2> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup_site">Hot site:</a></h2> 
    <p>An off-premises location where a companyâ€™s work can resume during 
        a disaster. A hot site has all the equipment necessary for a business 
        to resume regular activities, including jacks for phones, backup data, 
        computers and related peripherals.

    <h2> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backup_site">Cold Sites:</a></h2> 
    <p>A cold site is a backup facility; this site is a physical 
        space that consists of utilities such as power, air conditioning, 
        and networking capability needed by organizations to install 
        the necessary equipment to resume operations. Cold sites are not 
        expensive, but they require a long time for recovery.

    <p>In networking, a protocol is a standardized set of rules for formatting

    <p>Network Mapper is a free and open source utility for network 
        exploration and security auditing. Many systems and network 
        administrators also find it useful for tasks such as network inventory, 
        managing service upgrade schedules, and monitoring host or service 
        uptime.

    <p>A weakness that can be exploited by cybercriminals 
        to gain unauthorized access to a computer system1. It refers to 
        the quality or state of being exposed to the possibility of being 
        attacked or harmed, either physically or emotionally23.
